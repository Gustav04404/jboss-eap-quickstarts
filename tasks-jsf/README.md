tasks-jsf: JSF, JPA quickstart
==============================
Author: Lukas Fryc  
Level: Intermediate  
Technologies: JSF, JPA  
Summary: Provides a JSF 2.0 as view layer for the `tasks` quickstart  
Prerequisites: tasks  
Target Product: EAP  
Product Versions: EAP 6.1, EAP 6.2  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/>  

What is it?
-----------

This project demonstrates how to use JPA 2.0 persistence with JSF 2.0 as view layer.

The theme of this application is simple Task management with simple log in. The project contains two entities - a user and a task.

This sample includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java.

Persistence code is covered by tests to help you write business logic without the need to use any view layer.

JSF 2.0 is used to present user two views - authentication form and task view.

The task view is contains a task list, a task detail and a task addition form. The task view uses AJAX.

System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 or later. 

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.

_Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with JBoss EAP 6. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable and should NOT be used in a production environment!_

Configure Maven 
-------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.


Start the JBoss EAP Server
-------------------------

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server:

        For Linux:   JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\standalone.bat


Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the Quickstarts](../README.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean install jboss-as:deploy

4. This will deploy `target/jboss-tasks-jsf.war` to the running instance of the server.


Access the application 
---------------------

The application will be running at the following URL <http://localhost:8080/jboss-tasks-jsf>.


Server Log: Expected warnings and errors
-----------------------------------

_Note:_ You will see the following warnings and errors in the server log. Hibernate attempts to drop the table and constraints before they are created because the `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto` value is set to `create-drop`. You can ignore these warnings and errors.

        HHH000431: Unable to determine H2 database version, certain features may not work

        HHH000389: Unsuccessful: alter table Task drop constraint FK_kxfu633bvt1sptgbnkxkrr3qf
        Table "TASK" not found; SQL statement: alter table Task drop constraint FK_kxfu633bvt1sptgbnkxkrr3qf [42102-168]


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn jboss-as:undeploy


Run the Arquillian Tests 
-------------------------

This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container. 

_NOTE: The following commands assume you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Run the Arquillian Tests](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/RUN_ARQUILLIAN_TESTS.md#run-the-arquillian-tests) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:

        mvn clean test -Parq-jbossas-remote 


Run the Quickstart in JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JDBS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 


Debug the Application
---------------------

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

        mvn dependency:sources
        mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
